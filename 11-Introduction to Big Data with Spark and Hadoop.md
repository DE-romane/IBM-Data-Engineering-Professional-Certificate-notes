## W2 ❉ introduction to  hadoop
---
overview of various components and technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem.:

### 1. Hadoop Framework:
- **Open Source**: Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.
- **Challenges**: Hadoop may face challenges related to managing dependencies and dealing with low-level latency, which can impact performance.

### 2. MapReduce:
- **Parallel Computing Framework**: MapReduce is a parallel computing framework used in Hadoop for processing large datasets in parallel across distributed clusters.
- **Flexibility**: It is flexible and can handle various data types and processing needs across multiple industries.
- **Map and Reduce Tasks**: MapReduce consists of two major tasks: the "map" task, which processes input data and generates key-value pairs, and the "reduce" task, which aggregates and summarizes the output of map tasks.

### 3. Hadoop Ecosystem Stages:
- **Ingest**: Ingestion involves acquiring and importing data into the Hadoop ecosystem.
- **Store**: Storage involves storing the ingested data efficiently and reliably, typically using HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
- **Process and Analyze**: Processing and analysis involve performing computations and extracting insights from the stored data using frameworks like MapReduce, Spark, or Hive.
- **Access**: Access involves retrieving and querying the processed data for further analysis or visualization.

### 4. HDFS and Its Benefits:
- **Cost Efficiency**: HDFS provides cost-efficient storage for large volumes of data by distributing it across commodity hardware.
- **Scalability**: It is highly scalable and can accommodate the storage needs of petabytes of data.
- **Data Replication**: HDFS replicates data across multiple nodes for fault tolerance and data redundancy.
- **Rack Awareness**: Rack awareness reduces network traffic and improves cluster performance by considering the physical location of nodes within racks.
- **Write Once, Read Many (WORM)**: HDFS enables WORM operations, where data is written once and read multiple times, making it suitable for scenarios where data is primarily read-only.

### 5. Hive:
- **Data Warehouse Software**: Hive is a data warehouse software built on top of Hadoop, designed for querying and managing large datasets using a SQL-like language called HiveQL.
- **Schema Flexibility**: Hive follows the "write once, read many" approach and does not enforce a schema, allowing for schema-on-read data access.
- **Partitioning Support**: It offers built-in partitioning support for organizing data efficiently and improving query performance.

### 6. HBase:
- **Column-Oriented Nonrelational Database**: HBase is a column-oriented nonrelational database management system that runs on top of HDFS and provides real-time read/write access to large datasets.
- **Linear Scalability**: It offers linear scalability, enabling it to handle massive volumes of data with high efficiency.
- **Architecture Components**: HBase architecture consists of components like HMaster, Region Servers, Zookeeper, and HDFS, providing fault tolerance and high availability.
- **Dynamic Changes**: Unlike HDFS, HBase allows dynamic changes, providing flexibility in managing schema and data structures.

- **In-Memory Processing**: Spark keeps a substantial portion of the required data in memory, minimizing expensive disk I/O operations encountered with MapReduce, thereby improving performance.
- **Functional Programming**: Spark leverages functional programming concepts, emphasizing a declarative programming model focused on "what" to compute rather than "how" to compute, using expressions and lambda functions.

### 3. Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs):
- **Primary Data Abstraction**: RDDs are Spark's primary data abstraction, representing fault-tolerant collections of elements partitioned across nodes in a cluster.
- **Creation**: RDDs can be created from external or local Hadoop-supported files, collections, or other RDDs.
- **Immutability and Recoverability**: RDDs are immutable and always recoverable, providing resilience in Spark applications.
- **Persistence**: RDDs can persist or cache datasets in memory across operations, speeding up iterative operations and improving performance.

## W4 ❉ introduction to DataFrames & Spark SQL
---
### 1. RDDs and Fault Tolerance:
- **Primary Data Abstraction**: RDDs are Spark's primary data abstraction, representing distributed collections of data partitioned across nodes in a cluster.
- **Fault Tolerance with DAGs**: Spark uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to enable fault tolerance. When a node fails, Spark replicates the DAG and restores the node's state, ensuring fault tolerance in data processing.

### 2. Lazy Evaluation and Transformations:
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Transformations in Spark undergo lazy evaluation, meaning they are not executed until an action is called by the driver function. This optimization strategy improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary computation.

### 3. DataSets and DataFrames:
- **Combined Benefits**: DataSets are distributed collections of data that provide the benefits of both RDDs and SparkSQL.
- **Strongly Typed JVM Objects**: DataSets consist of strongly typed JVM objects, offering type safety and extending the capabilities of the object-oriented API.
- **API Compatibility**: DataSets work with both Scala and Java APIs, providing flexibility and ease of use across different programming languages.

- **Catalyst Optimizer**: Catalyst is Spark SQL's built-in rule-based query optimizer, performing analysis, logical optimization, physical planning, and code generation to optimize SQL queries.
- **Tungsten Optimizer**: Tungsten is Spark's built-in cost-based optimizer, focusing on optimizing CPU and memory usage for cache-friendly computation of algorithms and data structures.

### 5. DataFrame Operations and Pandas Integration:
- **Basic Operations**: DataFrame operations include reading, analysis, transformation, loading, and writing data. These operations enable data manipulation and analysis in Spark.
- **Pandas Integration**: Spark DataFrame operations can be performed using Pandas DataFrames in Python, leveraging functions like `printschema`, `select`, or `show` for data analysis tasks.

### 6. Spark SQL Capabilities:

## W5 ❉ Spark architecture
---
### 1. Spark Architecture:
- **Driver and Executor Processes**: The Spark architecture consists of a driver process and multiple executor processes. The driver coordinates the execution of the Spark program, while executors perform the actual computation on the cluster nodes.
- **SparkContext**: The SparkContext is the entry point for Spark applications, responsible for creating RDDs, distributing tasks, and managing resources across the cluster.

### 2. Execution Model:
- **Jobs and Tasks**: The driver creates jobs, which are then divided into tasks by the Spark Context. Tasks can be executed in parallel across the cluster's executors.
- **Stages and Shuffles**: Stages represent a set of tasks separated by a data shuffle, which involves costly data serialization, disk, and network I/O operations.

### 3. Cluster Managers:
- **Resource Management**: Cluster managers acquire resources and manage their allocation to Spark applications. Spark supports various cluster managers like Spark Standalone, YARN, Mesos, and Kubernetes.
- **Selection Criteria**: Choosing a cluster manager depends on factors such as ease of configuration, portability, deployment requirements, and compatibility with the existing data ecosystem.

### 4. Deployment Options:
- **Client vs. Cluster Mode**: The driver program can run in either client mode (outside the cluster) or cluster mode (within the cluster).
- **Local Mode**: Spark also supports running in local mode, which is useful for testing and debugging applications on a single machine.

### 5. Submission and Management:
- **spark-submit**: It is a unified interface used to submit Spark applications, regardless of the cluster manager or application language.
- **Configuration Options**: Mandatory options include specifying the cluster manager, deployment mode, and resource allocation settings.

### 6. Dependency Management:
- **Project Dependencies**: Application projects or libraries must be accessible to both driver and executor processes. This can be achieved by packaging dependencies into a JAR file or using a dependency management tool like Maven or SBT.

### 7. Spark Shell:
- **Interactive Environment**: Spark Shell provides an interactive environment for working with Spark, automatically initializing the SparkContext and providing access to the Spark API.
- **Simplifies Development**: It simplifies data exploration and experimentation by providing a convenient interface for running Spark code snippets.
