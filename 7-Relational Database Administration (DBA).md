They play a critical role in decision-making, providing expertise and guidance to ensure that the database system meets the organization's needs effectively and efficiently.
### Server Objects and Hierarchy

üìì**Storage Engines in MYSQL**
1. MySQL supports multiple storage engines, each with specific characteristics affecting performance and functionality.
2. Common storage engines in MySQL include InnoDB, MyISAM, MEMORY, MERGE, EXAMPLE, ARCHIVE, CSV, BLACKHOLE, and FEDERATED.
3. InnoDB is the default storage engine for MySQL 5.5 and later, providing ACID compliance, support for transactions, and row-level locking.
4. MyISAM is suitable for non-transactional tables, offering high-speed storage and retrieval along with full-text searching capabilities.
5. Commands for working with storage engines include SHOW ENGINES, CREATE TABLE, SET, and ALTER TABLE.

Code statements :
1. Example of creating a table with a specified storage engine:
```sql
   CREATE TABLE Products (i INT) ENGINE = INNODB;
   CREATE TABLE Product_Codes (i INT) ENGINE = CSV;
   CREATE TABLE History (i INT) ENGINE = MEMORY;
```

2. Example of setting the default storage engine:
```sql
SET default_storage_engine=ARCHIVE;
```

3. Example of altering a table to change its storage engine:
```sql
ALTER TABLE Products ENGINE = MEMORY;
```
---
üìì**MySQL Configuration, Storage Engines, and System Tables**

1. Connected to the `world` database using the CLI:
```
USE world;
```

2. Created a new table called `MyISAM_test` using the MyISAM storage engine:
```
CREATE TABLE MyISAM_test (i INT NOT NULL, c CHAR(10) NOT NULL) ENGINE = MYISAM;
```

3. Connected to the `information_schema` database using the CLI:
```
USE information_schema;
```

4. Queried the `TABLES` table in the `information_schema` database to display the `table_name` and `engine` columns of all tables where `table_schema = 'world'`:
```
SELECT table_name, engine FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE table_schema = 'world';
```

The output confirmed that the `MyISAM_test` table is present and indeed uses the MyISAM storage engine, as expected.

---
üìì**PostgreSQL Instance Configuration and System Catalog**

 the task is to change the name of a table called `aircrafts_data` to `aircraft_fleet` in a PostgreSQL database instance.

First, an attempt is made to change the table name by directly updating the `pg_tables` system catalog table using the following SQL command:

```sql
UPDATE pg_tables SET tablename = 'aircraft_fleet' WHERE tablename = 'aircrafts_data';
```

However, this attempt results in an error, highlighting the safeguard in place to prevent direct modifications to system catalog tables.

The correct approach is to use the `ALTER TABLE` statement to rename the table, as shown below:

```sql
ALTER TABLE aircrafts_data RENAME TO aircraft_fleet;
```

To confirm that the table was successfully renamed, a query is made to the `pg_tables` system catalog table filtering by `schemaname` to display the `tablename` column:

```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'bookings';
```

The output confirms that the table was successfully renamed to `aircraft_fleet`, and the changes are automatically reflected in the system catalog.

---

**‚û° 1. Instance:**

An instance in the context of a database refers to a logical boundary or environment where a specific database or set of databases is managed. It's like a container that holds all the data, configurations, and processes related to those databases. Each instance typically runs on a separate server or machine.

**Key Components of an Instance:**
- **Configuration Parameters:** These are settings that determine how the database instance behaves. They can include parameters related to memory allocation, cache size, parallel processing, logging, etc.
- **Database Objects:** These are the entities that make up the structure and content of the database.

**‚û° 2. Database Objects:**

Database objects are the building blocks of a database. They define the structure, relationships, and constraints within the database. Here are some common types:

- **Tables:** These store data in rows and columns.
- **Constraints:** Rules that enforce data integrity, such as uniqueness or foreign key relationships.
- **Indexes:** Data structures that improve the performance of queries by allowing quick retrieval of data.
- **Keys:** Columns or combination of columns that uniquely identify rows in a table.
- **Views:** Virtual tables generated from the result of a query.
- **Aliases:** Alternative names for database objects.
- **Triggers:** Actions automatically performed in response to certain events.
- **Events:** Actions or occurrences detected by the database management system (DBMS).
- **Log Files:** Records of changes made to the database.

**‚û° 3. System Objects:**
Different Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) use different terms to refer to their system objects, but they serve similar purposes. These objects are used by the database management system internally to manage and organize database resources. Common terms include:

- **System Schema:** A schema containing system objects.
- **System Tables:** Tables used by the DBMS to store metadata and manage internal processes.
- **Catalog:** A collection of metadata that describes the structure and properties of the database.
- **Directory:** A hierarchical structure used to organize and locate database objects.

 **‚û° 4. Database Storage:**

Database storage involves managing both logical database objects (like tables, indexes, etc.) and physical storage. 

- **Logical Database Objects:** These represent the structure and organization of data within the database. They define how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated.
- **Physical Storage:** This refers to the actual storage mechanisms used by the database management system to store data on disk or in memory. It includes file systems, data files, log files, and memory buffers.

In summary, an instance serves as a container for databases, holding configuration settings, and managing database objects. These objects include tables, indexes, and constraints, managed through system objects like system schemas or catalogs. Database storage encompasses both logical database objects and physical storage mechanisms.









## W2 ‚ùâ Managing Databases
### Backup and Restore Databases

üìì**Backup and Restore using PostgreSQL**
 the task is to correct the spelling of a passenger's first name in the database and perform a full backup of the database.

First, the original entry for the passenger with booking reference "0002D8" is viewed in the "tickets" table of the "restored_demo" database using the following SQL command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE booking_ref = '0002D8';
```

The output shows the ticket associated with the booking reference "0002D8" under the name "Saniya Koreleva".

Next, the entry for this passenger is modified to correct the spelling of the first name to "Sanya" by executing the following SQL command:

```sql
UPDATE tickets SET passenger_name = 'SANYA KORELEVA' WHERE booking_ref = '0002D8';
```

To perform a full backup of the "restored_demo" database, the following command can be used in the terminal:

```bash
pg_dump --username=postgres --host=localhost restored_demo > restored_demo_backup.sql
```

This command creates a backup of the "restored_demo" database named "restored_demo_backup.sql".

After performing the backup, the correctness of the modification can be verified by executing the same SQL command used earlier to view the entry for the passenger with booking reference "0002D8".

---
üìì**Backup and Restore using MySQL**

**Perform Logical Backup and Restore**
the goal is to perform a logical backup and restore of a database table.

First, a new database named "world_P1" is created using the MySQL CLI:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE world_P1;
```

Then, the newly created database is selected:

```sql
USE world_P1;
```

The "world_mysql_script.sql" script is executed to complete the database creation process:

```sql
SOURCE world_mysql_script.sql;
```

An attempt is made to retrieve all records with the country code 'BGD' from the "city" table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM city WHERE countrycode='BGD';
```

If this attempt fails, the database is updated using the "world_mysql_update_1.sql" script:

```sql
SOURCE world_mysql_update_1.sql;
```

A logical backup of the "city" table is then performed:

```bash
mysqldump --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=root --password world_P1 city > world_P1_city_mysql_backup.sql
```

Next, the "city" table is dropped from the database to simulate a scenario where it needs to be restored:

```bash
mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=root --password --execute="DROP TABLE world_P1.city;"
```

Finally, the backup is used to restore the "city" table:

```bash
mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=root --password world_P1 < world_P1_city_mysql_backup.sql
```

And the restored "city" table is queried to validate if the backup was successful:

```bash
mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=root --password --execute="SELECT * FROM world_P1.city;"
```

**Perform Physical Backup and Restore**
the goal is to perform a physical backup and restore of a database table.

First, a new database named "world_P2" is created using the MySQL CLI:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE world_P2;
```

Then, the newly created database is selected:

```sql
USE world_P2;
```

The "world_mysql_script.sql" script is executed to complete the database creation process:

```sql
SOURCE world_mysql_script.sql;
```

An attempt is made to retrieve all records with the country codes 'BGD' and 'CAN' from various tables:

```sql
SELECT * FROM country WHERE code IN ('BGD','CAN');
SELECT * FROM countrylanguage WHERE countrycode IN ('BGD','CAN');
SELECT * FROM city WHERE countrycode IN ('BGD','CAN');
```

If this attempt fails, the database is updated using the "world_mysql_update_2.sql" script:

```sql
SOURCE world_mysql_update_2.sql;
```

A physical backup of the database is then performed by copying the database directory:

```bash
docker cp mysql-mysql-1:/var/lib/mysql/world_P2 /home/project/mysql_world_P2_backup
```

Next, the "world_P2" database directory is removed from the MySQL server Docker container and the MySQL server is restarted:

```bash
docker exec mysql-mysql-1 rm -rf /var/lib/mysql/world_P2
docker exec -it mysql-mysql-1 mysqladmin -p shutdown
```

Afterwards, the backup is restored by copying the backup files back into the database directory:

```bash
docker cp /home/project/mysql_world_P2_backup/. mysql-mysql-1:/var/lib/mysql/world_P2
docker exec -it mysql-mysql-1 mysqladmin -p shutdown
```

And the restored tables are queried to validate if the backup was successful:

```bash
mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=root --password --execute="SELECT * FROM world_P2.city;"
```

This process ensures that a physical backup and restore of the database is performed successfully.

 **‚û° Types of Backups:**

1. **Full Backup:** A full backup captures the entire database at a specific point in time. It includes all data, objects, and configurations. While it ensures comprehensive recovery, it requires significant storage space and can be time-consuming.

2. **Point-in-Time Backup:** Also known as a "time-based" or "incremental-forever" backup, this type captures changes made to the database since the last full backup. It allows you to restore the database to any specific point in time, providing granular recovery options.

3. **Differential Backup:** A differential backup captures only the data that has changed since the last full backup. It is faster than a full backup and requires less storage space. However, restoration may take longer as it needs to apply the full backup followed by the differential backup.

4. **Incremental Backup:** An incremental backup captures only the data that has changed since the last backup, whether it's a full backup or an incremental backup. It offers faster backup times and requires less storage space compared to full backups and differential backups.
 
 **‚û° Physical vs. Logical Backups:**
- **Physical Backup:** This type of backup involves copying the physical files that constitute the database, such as data files, control files, and redo logs. It provides a bit-for-bit copy of the database, making it faster to restore but less flexible for granular recovery.

- **Logical Backup:** In contrast, a logical backup involves exporting logical database objects, such as tables, views, and stored procedures, into a file. It allows for selective restoration of individual objects but is slower and may not capture all database aspects compared to physical backups.
 **‚û° Hot vs. Cold Backups:**
- **Hot Backup:** A hot backup is taken while the database is still running and actively serving requests. It ensures minimal downtime but may impact performance during the backup process.

- **Cold Backup:** A cold backup is taken while the database is offline or in a quiescent state. It ensures data consistency but requires downtime, making it suitable for environments where downtime is acceptable.
 **‚û° Backup Policy:**
Your backup policy should be tailored to your organization's recovery needs and data usage patterns. Factors to consider include:
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** How much data loss is acceptable in the event of a disaster or failure.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** How quickly the system needs to be restored after a failure.
- **Data Retention Requirements:** How long backups need to be retained for compliance or operational purposes.
- **Frequency of Backups:** How often backups should be taken based on data volatility and business requirements.

 **‚û° Database Transaction Logs:**
Database transaction logs record all changes made to the database, including insertions, updates, and deletions. They provide a mechanism for recovering the database to a consistent state in the event of a failure or error. Transaction logs are crucial for maintaining data integrity and supporting various recovery scenarios, such as point-in-time recovery or rolling back transactions.

### Security and User Management

üìì**MySQL User Management, Access Control, and Encryption**

In MySQL, user management, access control, and encryption are crucial aspects of database security. 

1. **User Management**:
   - **Creating Users**: You can create new users using the `CREATE USER` statement, specifying their username and host from which they can connect.
 ```sql
CREATE USER 'username'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
 ```
   - **Altering Users**: You can modify user properties such as their password using the `ALTER USER` statement.
```sql
ALTER USER 'username'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
```
   - **Deleting Users**: To remove a user, you can use the `DROP USER` statement.
```sql
DROP USER 'username'@'hostname';
```

2. **Access Control**:
   - **Granting Privileges**: You can grant various privileges to users on specific database objects (tables, databases, etc.) using the `GRANT` statement.
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON database_name.table_name TO 'username'@'hostname';
```
   - **Revoking Privileges**: Similarly, you can revoke privileges using the `REVOKE` statement.
```sql
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON database_name.table_name FROM 'username'@'hostname';
```

3. **Roles**:
   - MySQL introduced roles in version 8.0.16. Roles are collections of privileges. You can create roles using `CREATE ROLE` and grant privileges to roles using `GRANT`.
```sql
CREATE ROLE rolename;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON database_name.table_name TO rolename;
```

4. **Default Privileges**:
   - MySQL allows you to set default privileges for users or roles at the global, database, table, or routine level using the `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` statement.
```sql
ALTER USER 'username'@'hostname' DEFAULT ROLE 'role1', 'role2';
```

5. **SSL/TLS Encryption**:
   - MySQL supports SSL/TLS encryption for securing connections between clients and the server. You need to configure SSL/TLS certificates on both the server and client sides.
   - To enforce SSL/TLS connections, set the `--require_secure_transport` option in the MySQL configuration file.

6. **Data Encryption**:
   - MySQL provides various encryption functions for encrypting data stored in the database. You can use functions like `AES_ENCRYPT()` and `AES_DECRYPT()` to encrypt and decrypt data.
   - It's also possible to use application-level encryption before storing data in the database.

7. **Authentication Plugins**:
   - MySQL supports authentication plugins for secure user authentication. Plugins such as `caching_sha2_password` and `mysql_native_password` provide different levels of security for authenticating users.

8. **Audit Logging**:
   - MySQL Enterprise Edition offers audit log plugins for tracking user activity, including logins, queries executed, and privilege changes.

Regularly review and update user permissions, access control settings, and encryption mechanisms to ensure the security of your MySQL database. Additionally, consider implementing best practices such as using strong passwords, limiting privileges to the minimum required for users, and regularly auditing user access and permissions.

---
üìì**User Management and Access Control in PostgreSQL**
In PostgreSQL, user management and access control are essential components for maintaining the security and integrity of your database system. 

1. **User Management**:

```sql
CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password';
```
   - **Altering Users**: You can modify user properties such as their password using the `ALTER USER` statement.
```sql
ALTER USER username WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
```
   - **Deleting Users**: To remove a user, you can use the `DROP USER` statement.
```sql
DROP USER username;
```

2. **Access Control**:
   - **Granting Privileges**: You can grant various privileges to users on specific database objects (tables, schemas, sequences, etc.) using the `GRANT` statement.
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON table_name TO username;
```
   - **Revoking Privileges**: Similarly, you can revoke privileges using the `REVOKE` statement.
```sql
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON table_name FROM username;
```

3. **Roles**:
   - **Creating Roles**: Roles are database-wide entities that can group multiple users together. You can create roles using the `CREATE ROLE` statement.
```sql
CREATE ROLE rolename;
```
   - **Granting Roles**: You can grant roles to users using the `GRANT` statement.
```sql
GRANT rolename TO username;
```
   - **Role Hierarchy**: PostgreSQL supports role hierarchies, where roles can inherit privileges from other roles.

4. **Default Privileges**:
   - You can set default privileges for a schema using the `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` statement. This ensures that any new objects created within that schema inherit specified privileges.
```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA schema_name GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO rolename;
```

5. **Schema-level Access Control**:
   - PostgreSQL allows you to control access at the schema level using the `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements.
```
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO rolename;
```

6. **Row-level Security**:
   - PostgreSQL supports Row-level Security (RLS), allowing you to restrict which rows users can access based on defined policies.

7. **SSL/TLS Authentication**:
   - PostgreSQL supports SSL/TLS encryption for secure client-server communication. You can enforce SSL/TLS connections in your `pg_hba.conf` file.

8. **Authentication Methods**:
   - PostgreSQL supports various authentication methods including password authentication, certificate authentication, LDAP authentication, etc. These can be configured in the `pg_hba.conf` file.

It's crucial to regularly review and update user permissions and access control settings to ensure the security of your PostgreSQL database. Additionally, consider implementing best practices such as using strong passwords, limiting privileges to the minimum required for users, and regularly auditing user access and permissions.

---
**‚û° 1. Authentication vs. Authorization:**

- **Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through credentials like usernames, passwords, or biometric information.
- **Authorization:** The process of granting or denying access rights and permissions to users based on their authenticated identity. It determines what actions users are allowed to perform within the system.

**‚û° 2. Securing a Database:**

- **Server and Operating System Security:** Ensure the server hosting the database and the operating system are properly configured and secured against unauthorized access, malware, and other security threats.
- **Database and Data Security:** Implement security measures within the database system, such as user authentication, authorization, encryption of data at rest and in transit, and auditing to monitor and track access and changes to the data.

**‚û° 3. Database User, Groups, and Roles:**

- **Database User:** An individual account allowed to access specific database objects.
- **Groups:** Logical collections of users that simplify user management by allowing permissions to be assigned to the group rather than individual users.
- **Roles:** Sets of permissions or privileges needed to perform specific functions or tasks within the database. Roles can be assigned to users or groups, enabling the principle of least privilege.

**‚û° 4. Principle of Least Privilege:**

Grant users only the permissions they need to perform their job functions and nothing more. This minimizes the potential damage that can be caused by a compromised account and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**‚û° 5. Auditing:**

- **Auditing:** The process of monitoring and recording database activities to ensure compliance with security policies, track changes, and detect potential security breaches.
- Auditing helps identify security gaps, enforce security policies, and investigate security incidents or violations.

**‚û° 6. Customer-Managed Keys:**

- **Customer-Managed Keys:** Encryption keys used to encrypt and decrypt data stored in the cloud. Unlike provider-managed keys, which are managed by the cloud service provider, customer-managed keys provide data owners with greater control and ownership over their encryption keys, enhancing data security and compliance.

In summary, securing a database involves implementing authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms, as well as auditing to monitor and track access and changes. It's important to follow security best practices, such as the principle of least privilege, and consider all layers of security, including the server, operating system, database, and data itself. Additionally, customer-managed keys provide data owners with more control over their data stored in the cloud.

   - Use a text editor to create shell scripts (.sh files) for each task you want to automate. Make sure the scripts have execute permissions (`chmod +x script.sh`).
   - Here's an example of a basic shell script to perform a MySQL backup:

```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # MySQL Credentials
   DB_USER="username"
   DB_PASSWORD="password"
   DB_NAME="database_name"
   
   # Backup Directory
   BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup"

   # Backup Filename
   BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/$DB_NAME-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).sql"

   # Perform Backup
   mysqldump -u$DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME > $BACKUP_FILE
   
   # Check if Backup Succeeded
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "Backup completed successfully: $BACKUP_FILE"
   else
       echo "Backup failed"
       exit 1
   fi
```

3. **Customize Scripts**:
   - Customize the scripts according to your specific requirements, such as specifying the MySQL database name, backup directory, file names, etc.
   - You can add additional commands to the scripts to perform other tasks like database maintenance, data imports, exports, etc.

4. **Schedule Script Execution**:
   - Use cron or a similar scheduling tool to automate the execution of your shell scripts at specified intervals.
   - Edit the crontab file (`crontab -e`) and add an entry to schedule the script execution. For example, to run the backup script daily at midnight:

```bash
   0 0 * * * /path/to/backup_script.sh
```

5. **Test and Monitor**:
   - Test your shell scripts to ensure they work as expected and perform the desired tasks.
   - Monitor the script execution and check the output/logs regularly to verify that tasks are being completed successfully.

By automating tasks with shell scripts, you can save time and effort on routine database maintenance and administrative tasks, while ensuring consistency and reliability in your MySQL environment.
