# IBM-Data-Engineering-Professional-Certificate-notes

I am thrilled to share my journey of completing the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate. This program has been an incredible learning experience, providing me with practical skills and knowledge essential for a career in data engineering.

## Program Overview

Throughout the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate, I delved into various aspects of data engineering:

- **Relational Databases**: I learned to create, design, and manage relational databases, applying concepts of database administration to RDBMSs like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM Db2.
  
- **NoSQL and Big Data Technologies**: The program introduced me to NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra, Cloudant, and Big Data technologies including Hadoop, Apache Spark, Spark SQL, Spark ML, and Spark Streaming.
  
- **ETL and Data Pipelines**: I gained hands-on experience in implementing ETL processes and building data pipelines using Bash, Airflow, and Kafka.
  
- **Data Warehousing**: I learned to architect, populate, and deploy data warehouses, along with creating BI reports and interactive dashboards.

## Skills Acquired

Throughout the program, I developed proficiency in a wide range of skills, including:

- **Programming**: I honed my skills in Python, particularly in libraries such as Numpy and Pandas, and learned web scraping techniques.
  
- **Database Management**: I gained expertise in SQL, database design, architecture, security, and administration for both relational and NoSQL databases.
  
- **Big Data Technologies**: I worked extensively with Apache Spark, Spark SQL, Spark ML, Spark Streaming, and Hadoop.
  
- **Shell Scripting**: I learned to write Bash scripts for various tasks in a Unix/Linux environment.
  
- **Version Control**: I utilized Git and GitHub for collaborative development and version control.

## Projects Highlights

Some of the exciting projects I completed as part of the certificate program include:

- Designing a relational database to optimize operations for a coffee franchise.
  
- Querying various datasets, including census, crime, and school demographic data, using SQL.
  
- Writing a Bash shell script on Linux for file backups.
  
- Setting up, testing, and optimizing a data platform containing MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM Db2 databases.
  
- Analyzing road traffic data, performing ETL, and creating a pipeline using Airflow and Kafka.
  
- Designing and implementing a data warehouse for a solid-waste management company.
  
- Working with NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, and Cloudant, and analyzing data within them.
  
- Training a machine learning model using Apache Spark.
