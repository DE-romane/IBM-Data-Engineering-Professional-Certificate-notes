## Description
- The tasks' solutions are included as snapshot due to IBM Assignment template
- MySQL is used as OTLP Database to hold transactional data
- The SQL codes are documented in **code.sql**
- Task 8 only asks to write a backup bash for the table sales_data, however I also make a backup bash for the whole sales database if needed. The bash can be automated using **cron**.
