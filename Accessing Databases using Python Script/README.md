# Accessing Databases using Python Script

## Project Overview

Databases serve as a crucial means of storing and accessing information efficiently. This project focuses on leveraging Python to create a database, loading data from a CSV file into a database table, and executing queries to access and manage data.

## Objectives

Throughout this lab, the primary objectives are to:

- **Create a Database using Python**: Establish a database environment to manage and store data effectively.
- **Load CSV Data to Database Table**: Import data from a CSV file into a database table.
- **Execute Queries on the Database**: Run basic queries to retrieve and manage information from the database.

## Scenario

Imagine a dataset containing employee records provided in a CSV file to the HR team. As a Data Engineer, the task is to create a database named 'STAFF' and load the CSV file's contents into a table named 'INSTRUCTORS'. The dataset headers and their descriptions are as follows:

| Header | Description          |
|--------|----------------------|
| ID     | Employee ID          |
| FNAME  | First Name           |
| LNAME  | Last Name            |
| CITY   | City of residence    |
| CCODE  | Country code (2 letters) |

## Key Steps

1. **Database Creation**: Use Python to create a database environment named 'STAFF'.
2. **Loading Data**: Load the CSV file contents into a database table named 'INSTRUCTORS'.
3. **Query Execution**: Execute SQL queries using Python to access and manage data within the 'INSTRUCTORS' table.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical learning experience in leveraging Python to interact with databases. It equips you with the necessary skills to establish a database, import data from CSV files, and perform data retrieval and manipulation using SQL queries.
