    - **Type of Data:** Understanding the nature of the data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) to choose appropriate storage.
    - **Database Types:** Relational databases (RDBMS) for structured data; NoSQL databases for schema-less and free-form data.
    - **Volume of Data:** Selection between data lake for large volumes in native format or big data repositories for high-velocity diverse data.
    - **Intended Use of Data:** Purpose drives choices - transactional systems for high-volume operations, analytical systems for complex queries.
    - **Scalability:** The capability of the data store to handle growth in data, workloads, and users.
    - **Normalization:** Efficient organization of data; crucial for transactional systems but can impact performance in analytical systems.

- **Design Considerations from a Storage Perspective:**
    - **Performance:** Parameters like throughput, latency, and access time are crucial.
    - **Availability:** Ensuring continuous access to data without downtime.
    - **Integrity:** Data must be protected from corruption, loss, and external threats.
    - **Recoverability:** Ability to retrieve data in case of failures or disasters.

  4. **Data Security:**
     - Focuses on protecting data at rest (storage) and in motion (transit).
     - Includes authentication, authorization, and encryption for data protection whether at rest or in motion (using HTTPS, SSL, TLS).

- **Data Life Cycle Security Considerations:**
  - Addressing vulnerabilities at different stages of the data life cycle.
  - Emphasizing the need for proactive monitoring, tracking, and reacting to security violations.
  - Importance of end-to-end visibility and integration of security processes and tools for effective security monitoring and intelligence.

- **Corporate-Level Security Policy:**
  - Essential for every enterprise to align business, IT, and stakeholders towards achieving security goals.
  - Involves contributions from people, policies, processes, systems, and tools.

‚û°Ô∏è**Importance of Data Security**

- **Data Security is Paramount:**
  - If data isn't secure, its value diminishes considerably. Serious data breaches can occur, impacting the organization's viability, particularly for smaller businesses where data loss can be potentially company-ending.
  
- **Continuous Vigilance for Data Security:**
  - Data security isn't an afterthought; it's a constant concern that needs to be integrated into every stage of data management, from conception to implementation and ongoing maintenance.

- **Value of Data and its Protection:**
  - Data is considered today's most valuable resource, surpassing even oil. Hence, safeguarding data becomes imperative, and failure to do so can result in catastrophic consequences.

- **Broad Responsibility for Data Security:**
  - Data security, governance, and compliance aren't solely the responsibility of data engineers. They should be integral across organizational processes, with every department involved in ensuring security measures are followed.

- **Access Management and Least Privilege Principle:**
  - Limiting access to production data and providing the least privilege necessary for each user's role is crucial. Granting excessive access poses a higher risk of data breaches.

- **Internal Threats vs. External Threats:**
  - While external threats are concerning, most data breaches originate from within an organization. Unauthorized access by insiders poses a significant risk to data security.

- **Value and Protection of Data:**
  - Data is likened to a natural resource in the world of Big Data, and it's imperative to safeguard this valuable asset. Failing to protect data can lead to severe consequences, including being involved in data breaches that can damage or even shut down a business.

- **Data Security Encompasses Recovery and Restoration:**
  - Beyond preventing unauthorized access, part of data security involves ensuring data recovery and restoration in the event of hardware failures or data loss incidents.

Overall, the consensus among these professionals is that data security isn't just a technical aspect but a fundamental concern that needs attention from all levels of an organization, from data engineers to higher management and across departments, to mitigate risks and protect valuable data assets.
